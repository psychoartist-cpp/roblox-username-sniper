A simple C++ username sniper. Change the settings in "roblox sniper.cpp" defines.
I highly recommend to not lower the request delay, as it will heat up the roblox API and rate limit us.
You can also use the prebuilt sniper in the x64/debug catalog. It's configuration is:
5 character length
50 users to generate
valid_users.txt as the file
birthday as 2002-02-02
request delay as 350 milliseconds.
